This tour starts at the Tourist Information Office and passes the main entrance 
to The Tivoli Gardens on the way to the Town Hall Square where the Old City begins. 
The symbolism on the Town Hall facade tells us something about the history of 
Copenhagen and its development from a fishing village into a European commercial 
capital. This will include a brief introduction into the history of Denmark from 
its earliest days until today, along with an overview of the Danish economy and 
the products the Danes produce. The Town Hall Square abounds with interesting 
landmarks such as The Dragon Fountain and The Lur-Blasers column, whose musical 
warriors remind us of Scandinavia's colorful Viking past. Crossing over the areas 
where the old moat and city rampart once stood, we pass though what would have 
been the Western Gate into the city that welcomed the 14-year-old aspiring actor, 
Hans Christian Andersen back in 1819. Today this spot marks the beginning of the 
Walking Street (called 'Stroget'), Copenhagen's fashion and design center, where 
we turn left on our way to the Latin Quarter with well-preserved examples of 19th-century 
residential architecture. <br>
<br>
After admiring the neo-classic facade of the Church of Our Lady (The Cathedral 
of Copenhagen) and the Reformation Monument just opposite it, we will enter the 
church to see the impressive marble sculptures of Christ and the Apostles by the 
greatest sculptor of the 19th-century, Bertel Thorvaldsen. After hearing about 
Thorvaldsen, the Golden Age of Danish Culture, religion in Denmark and an introduction 
to the Royal Family, we will walk across Our Lady's Square to see the oldest buildings 
in Copenhagen University and to learn about education, the social system in Denmark 
and the tax system which funds it. With a short break for restrooms we continue 
past the majestic University Library building along a street with antique bookshops 
where we will hear about some of Denmark's famous literary figures such as Ludwig 
Holberg, Soren Kierkegaard, Karen Blixen and Peter Hoeg. Our next stop is in front 
of the Great Synagogue of Copenhagen where we will learn about Denmark 's Jewish 
community and their heroic rescue from the Gestapo during the Nazi occupation 
of The Second World War. Opposite the synagogue is the Main Library of Copenhagen 
where free internet service is available. <br>
<br>
Continuing down the street we arrive at Kobmagergade, another important shopping 
street, where we find the Round Tower Observatory and the Trinity Church which 
adjoins it. Here we will meet King Christian IV, Denmark's Renaissance monarch, 
at whose request the buildings were built, and hear about his many accomplishments 
before proceeding on to the Rosenborg Garden, (also known as 'The King's Garden' 
in his honor), to admire the Rosenborg Castle which once served as a royal summer 
residence. The tour concludes at a statue to the poet and fairytale-writer, Hans 
Christian Andersen, where we will learn something more about his life and relationship 
to Copenhagen.  From where this tour ends one can enjoy a relaxing Danish smorrebrod 
lunch in a nearby cafe before joining the Rosenborg Castle Tour at 12 noon.
