From the Tourist information Office we walk to the Town Hall Square where we hear 
something about the history of Copenhagen and the economy of Denmark as we examine 
the symbolism on the Town Hall Building as well as the statues and fountains which 
surround it. Entering the Town Hall, we are greeted by the sight of a large and 
decorative entrance hall containing busts of famous Danes from the fields of architecture, 
sculpture, literature and science. From the statue of Hans Christian Andersen 
in the Town Hall Square we walk along the boulevard named for him past the Museum 
of Danish Design on our way to the Ny Carlberg  Glyptotek, an art museum housed 
in a magnificent turn-of-the-century building. We will hear something about the 
museum collections and the Golden age of Danish Culture whose painting and sculptures 
it contains. After passing the National History Museum located in an 18th-century 
prince's palace, we cross the Marble Bridge which brings us over a canal and onto 
the Castle Island. <br>
<br>
Here we find the magnificent Christiansborg Palace, home to the Parliament of 
Denmark, the Prime Minister's Office, the Supreme Court and the Royal Reception 
Rooms. We will learn something about the government of Denmark, the Welfare Model, 
the tax system which supports it, and the Royal Family. Crossing the Royal Riding 
Grounds with the beautiful sandstone Royal Stables and Court Theatre, we walk 
over to the garden of the Royal Library where the Provisions House and the Arsenal 
Building built around 1600 remind us that this was once King Christian IV's naval 
harbor. After learning about Denmark 's colorful Renaissance monarch, called 'The 
Builder King' we stroll around the garden pond and over to a statue of the 19th-century 
existentialist philosopher, Soren Kierkegaard, to learn about his life and works. 
<br>
<br>
Leaving the garden, we arrive at the Old Stock Exchange with its dragon-spire, 
built in the Dutch-renaissance style during the reign of King Christian IV. Across 
the canal from the Old Stock Exchange is Holmen's Church built by Christian IV 
for the sailors who lived and worked nearby. We admire the broad inner-harbor 
as we cross Knipples Bridge to Christianshavn, a merchant-area and southern fortification 
of Copenhagen built in the renaissance by King Christian IV. Merchant's homes 
and charming old warehouses line the streets which bring us to one of the canals 
which traverse this part of the city. Our tour ends by Our Savior's Church with 
an external spiral-staircase winding around its copper-covered tower. Here we 
will learn something about religion in Denmark and the alternative community called 
Christiania located only a few blocks away.
