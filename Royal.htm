This tour begins at the Tourist Information Office and crosses the Town Hall Square 
with Copenhagen's Town Hall Building, Dragon Fountain and statue of Hans Christian 
Andersen. After a brief introduction into Copenhagen and Denmark, we stop at the 
beginning of the Walking Street (called Stroget) to admire the magnificent Town 
Hall Tower and the Lur-Blasers column whose musical warriors remind us of the 
colorful Viking period and where we will hear something about their heroic exploits 
and explorations. Turning down a quiet backstreet, we arrive at the Old Prison 
of Copenhagen and the 'Bridge of Sighs' which connects it to the Old Courthouse 
and previous Town Hall of Copenhagen. These are two of the finest examples of 
the 19th-century, Greek- and Roman-inspired neo-classic architecture which typified 
the Copenhagen rebuilt after a city-fire and the bombardment of the Napoleonic 
War. In front of the Old Court House was a market square where today we find a 
monument to the city's whipping-post. Today a large bank building marks the place 
where the childhood home of the 19th-century existentialist philosopher, Soren 
Kierkegaard used to stand.  After hearing something about Kierkegaard and the 
Golden Age of Danish Culture we wander down a 15th-century backstreet with half-timbered 
houses to where the Old Fish Market once stood, today a weekend antique market 
in the summer months where we will stop to admire Thorvaldsen's Museum just opposite 
us on the other side of the canal which surrounds the Castle Island. We will meet 
the last of the fishwives still selling fish by a bridge going over the canal, 
and from where we can see a statue to Bishop Absalon, the founder of Copenhagen, 
as well as the Queen's Private Chapel and the Christiansborg Parliament building. 
In the canal is an underwater sculpture-grouping based on the folktale of Agnete 
and the  Merman. <br>
<br>
With a brief stop in the market-square of Amagertorv (where the cleanest and most 
historic restrooms in the city are found) we will follow the Walking Street to 
the King's New Square (called 'Kongens Nytorv') with the Opera House and Charlottenborg 
Palace. Nearby is the colorful harbor-area of Nyhavn whose merchant’s homes and 
half-timbered warehouses remind us of the salty old seaport and trading city that 
was Copenhagen. <br>
<br>
As we near the French-inspired, 18th-century rococo palaces of Amalienborg, the 
Royal Family's winter residences, we will learn something about Queen Margrethe II and the Royal Family 
as well as about the Royal Guard in their bearskin hats and colorful uniforms 
who stand guard outside the palaces and whose job it is to protect The Queen. 
The tour then passes the Russian Church with its characteristic golden cupolas 
to conclude by the Marble Church with its majestic neo-classic facade above which 
rises one of the largest domes in Northern Europe. Outside the church is a stature 
to N.F.S. Gruntvig, the 19th-century Lutheran minister, poet, historian, economist, 
politician and educator who among other things founded Denmark's Folk High School.
